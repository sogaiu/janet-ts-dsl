# XXX: use postwalk for tree construction from existing tree

#      for processing :rules, have an "in-progress" table that
#      contains things that have been "expanded" keyed by name
#      (e.g. :_lit)

#      in postwalk's function argument, examine the current "node".
#      if it's something to be "expanded" (e.g. keyword that has a
#      name thats' all uppercase + underscores), look up what it
#      should be replaced with in the in-progress table.  if something
#      is there already, use it.  if there is nothing there for a
#      particular key, initiate a process to build / expand
#      appropriately.  when done, put the result in the in-progress
#      table.  then return to the point after the lookup and use the
#      built result.

#      similar process seems like it should be doable for :_tokens.
#      tokens handling may require at least one more pass or more
#      processing to handle :regex arg concatenation

# XXX: there's no attempt to detect infinite loops
